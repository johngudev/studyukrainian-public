<h3>Verbal aspect</h3>
<p>To understand the concept of verbal aspect, it&rsquo;s helpful to think of two different ways of capturing a given moment on camera:</p>
<ul>
<li>üì∑ with a photograph</li>
<li>üé• with video</li>
</ul>
<p>A photograph captures a specific event at a specific moment in time. A video captures a continuous action that occurs over a period of time.</p>
<p>Analogously, in Ukrainian there are two aspects that a given verb may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>perfect</li>
<li>imperfect</li>
</ul>
<p>More precisely, we typically say that every verb in the Ukrainian language falls into one of these two categories.</p>

<p>Perfect verbs are verbs that are used to describe completed actions. You can think of these as specific actions that happened at a specific moment in time (actions that can be expressed with a photograph). Imperfect verbs are verbs used to describe continuous actions or habitual actions (i.e. actions that can be expressed via video).</p>
<p>If you have studied French or Spanish, you will have encountered the perfect and imperfect aspects in the preterite tense and the imperfect tense.</p>
