<h1 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Study Ukrainian Flashcards Are Now Live!</strong></span></h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Study Ukrainian now has an online flashcards system!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You can now use our website as a platform to study Ukrainian phrases and vocabulary by creating flashcards and studying them directly on the website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>You can use this system whether you access the site on desktop or on your smartphone!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you create an account and log in to the website, you can now save each sentence and phrase from the lesson dialogues as a flashcard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Our platform will automatically begin quizzing you on these flashcards when you enter the &ldquo;study flashcards&rdquo; page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Spaced repetition</strong></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These flashcards use the principle of spaced repetition to ensure that you really learn the words and phrases that you study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Essentially, you are tested on each word or phrase at increasing intervals until the new word or phrase becomes a part of your long-term memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The first time you learn a phrase, you may be tested on that phrase the next day, and then again two days after that, and then again after a week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This system has been shown by loads of research to help learners get new vocabulary and concepts to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; in your mind, and it&rsquo;s one of the most valuable principles that language-learners use to learn new vocabulary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Language learners who are familiar with Anki will recognize this approach:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Think of our platform as an Anki deck that you can access directly on the site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Spaced repetition is also the same principle used by other language learning apps like Duolingo.</span></p>
