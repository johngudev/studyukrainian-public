New Website Features in 2024
<p>Hello Ukrainian Learners!</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that we're going to be introducing some exciting new features and content in 2024.&nbsp; My plan is to make studyukrainian.com a one-stop resource where you can not only learn new Ukrainian vocabulary and grammar concepts, but also practice the things that you've learned at your own pace.&nbsp; As always, the goal is to make this site a resource that teaches you practical and relevant Ukrainian language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ready to see what's next?&nbsp; Here's a roundup of the features and content we're planning to implement this year:</p>
<h3><strong>Personal Accounts</strong></h3>
<p>With your personal account, you'll have your own account where you'll be able to keep track of your study progress.&nbsp; Our aim is to allow you to have personalized space where you track what you've learned, so that you have a clear sense of your progress and what you should learn next.</p>
<h3><strong>Flashcard System</strong></h3>
<p>This is a pet project that I've been wanting to develop for years.&nbsp; I love smart flashcard systems like Anki and I've wanted to implement one for this site for a while.&nbsp; The flashcard system will connect individual flashcards to your account at studyukrainian.com and use the principle of spaced repetition to determine when to test you on the things that you've learned.&nbsp; For example, after a learning a new word or phrase, you'll be quizzed on that new word or phrase the next day, then after an interval of two days, then after an interval of four days, then after an interval of a week, and so on.&nbsp; Studies have shown that spaced repetition is the most efficient way to store lots of new information in your long-term memory.&nbsp; I can't wait to see this feature turbo-charge your learning.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehensive Grammar Guide</strong></h3>
<p>The number one request I get from Ukrainian-language learners is for help on Ukrainian grammar.&nbsp; With its case system and with characteristics like verbal aspect, Ukrainian grammar can be a beast to learn.&nbsp; In 2024, our website will be updated with a comprehensive guide to Ukrainian grammar.&nbsp; I also plan to create tools via the newly-implemented flashcard system to help learners drill and memorize the grammar concepts they're learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to get access to these features</h2>
<p>These features will be rolled out over the course of the year.&nbsp; And you'll start to see them on this website soon.&nbsp; If you want to get early access, send an email to studyukrainianwebsite@gmail.com and we'll get you access to our new features.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you guys!</p>
